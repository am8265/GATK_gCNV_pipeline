# Copy Number Variant Analysis using GATK-gCNV pipeline on 425 Interstitial Cystitis samples

## Overview
This repository contains scripts and resources for Copy Number Variant (CNV) analysis on and Interstitial Cystitis Cohort (n=425) using the Genome Analysis Toolkit's germline CNV (GATK-gCNV) pipeline.
The GATK-gCNV pipeline could be used for other datasets.
